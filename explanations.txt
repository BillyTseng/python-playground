Question 1:
I used the concept of the hash map to store the counts of upper and lower case of alphabets
for source and target string. By harnessing them, I can achieve O(n) in time complicity.
Moreover, I only need two constant length list to store the hash maps.
The Space complicity is O(1)

Question 2:
By using recursion, I break the input string into a smallest string to process it.
The time complicity is O(2^n), and the space complicity is O(1).
